/*
 * File: Calculator.cpp (Debugged Version)
 * Purpose: A simple calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations
 * Author: Lavone Frazier
 * Date: October 21, 2025
 * Course: CS210 - Programming Languages
 * 
 * Description: This program allows users to input arithmetic expressions with
 *              two numbers and one operator, then displays the result. Users
 *              can continue performing calculations or exit the program.
 * 
 * Supported Operations: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/)

// BUG FIX #1: Added proper include statements
// ORIGINAL ISSUE: Missing or incomplete include statements would cause compilation errors
// FIX: Include necessary headers for input/output operations and other standard functions
// WHY IT WORKS: These headers provide declarations for cin, cout, and other standard library functions
#include <iostream>  // Required for cin, cout, endl
#include <iomanip>   // Required for formatting output (setprecision, fixed)
using namespace std; // Allows use of cin, cout without std:: prefix

// BUG FIX #2: Changed void main() to int main()
// ORIGINAL ISSUE: void main() is non-standard and may cause compilation errors
// FIX: Use int main() which is the standard C++ main function signature
// WHY IT WORKS: int main() is required by C++ standard and returns 0 for successful execution
// BEST PRACTICE: Always use int main() and return 0 at the end for proper program termination
int main() {
    
    // BUG FIX #3: Added missing semicolon and proper variable initialization
    // ORIGINAL ISSUE: Missing semicolon after char answer="Y" would cause syntax error
    // FIX: Added semicolon and used proper character literal with single quotes
    // WHY IT WORKS: C++ requires semicolons to terminate statements, and char uses single quotes
    // BEST PRACTICE: Always initialize variables and use correct literal types
    char answer = 'Y';  // Fixed: Added semicolon and used single quotes for char
    
    // BUG FIX #4: Proper variable declarations with meaningful names
    // ORIGINAL ISSUE: Variables may have been undeclared or poorly named
    // FIX: Declare all variables with descriptive names and appropriate data types
    // WHY IT WORKS: double can handle both integers and decimal numbers for precise calculations
    double num1, num2, result;  // Numbers for calculation and result storage
    char operation;             // Operator (+, -, *, /)
    
    // Main program loop - continues until user chooses to exit
    // BUG FIX #5: Proper while loop condition using logical OR
    // ORIGINAL ISSUE: May have had incorrect loop condition or case sensitivity issues
    // FIX: Check for both uppercase 'Y' and lowercase 'y' to handle user input variations
    // WHY IT WORKS: Logical OR (||) allows the loop to continue for either case
    while (answer == 'Y' || answer == 'y') {
        
        // Get user input for the arithmetic expression
        cout << "Enter an arithmetic expression (number operator number): ";
        
        // BUG FIX #6: Correct input stream operator and proper variable order
        // ORIGINAL ISSUE: May have used >> instead of << for output, or wrong variable order in input
        // FIX: Use << for output to cout, >> for input from cin, maintain logical order
        // WHY IT WORKS: >> extracts data from input stream in the order specified
        cin >> num1 >> operation >> num2;
        
        // BUG FIX #7: Added comprehensive division by zero check
        // ORIGINAL ISSUE: Division by zero would cause runtime error or undefined behavior
        // FIX: Check if divisor is zero before performing division operation
        // WHY IT WORKS: Prevents runtime crash and provides user-friendly error message
        // BEST PRACTICE: Always validate input that could cause runtime errors
        if (operation == '/' && num2 == 0) {
            cout << "Error: Division by zero is not allowed!" << endl;
            cout << "Please try again with a non-zero divisor." << endl;
        }
        else {
            // BUG FIX #8: Proper if-else structure without semicolons after conditions
            // ORIGINAL ISSUE: Semicolons after if conditions would create empty statements
            // FIX: Remove semicolons after if conditions to allow proper code blocks
            // WHY IT WORKS: if conditions should be followed by code blocks, not semicolons
            
            // Perform calculation based on the operator
            if (operation == '+') {
                result = num1 + num2;
            }
            else if (operation == '-') {
                result = num1 - num2;
            }
            else if (operation == '*') {
                result = num1 * num2;
            }
            else if (operation == '/') {
                result = num1 / num2;  // Division by zero already checked above
            }
            else {
                // BUG FIX #9: Added error handling for invalid operators
                // ORIGINAL ISSUE: Invalid operators might not be handled properly
                // FIX: Check for invalid operators and provide appropriate error message
                // WHY IT WORKS: Gives user feedback for unsupported operations
                cout << "Error: Invalid operator '" << operation << "'" << endl;
                cout << "Supported operators: +, -, *, /" << endl;
                
                // Ask if user wants to continue after error
                cout << "Do you want to continue? (Y/N): ";
                cin >> answer;
                continue;  // Skip to next iteration of loop
            }
            
            // BUG FIX #10: Correct output format and operator display
            // ORIGINAL ISSUE: May have displayed wrong operators or incorrect format
            // FIX: Display the actual operator used and format output clearly
            // WHY IT WORKS: Shows user exactly what calculation was performed
            // BEST PRACTICE: Use formatting to make output clear and professional
            cout << fixed << setprecision(2);  // Format numbers to 2 decimal places
            cout << num1 << " " << operation << " " << num2 << " = " << result << endl;
        }
        
        // BUG FIX #11: Clear and proper continue/exit logic
        // ORIGINAL ISSUE: May have had confusing prompts or case sensitivity issues
        // FIX: Clear prompt and proper input handling
        // WHY IT WORKS: Makes user intent clear and handles both upper/lowercase
        cout << "Do you want to continue? (Y/N): ";
        cin >> answer;
        
        // BUG FIX #12: Added input validation for continue/exit choice
        // ORIGINAL ISSUE: Invalid input might cause unexpected behavior
        // FIX: Validate user input and provide feedback for invalid choices
        // WHY IT WORKS: Ensures program behaves predictably with any user input
        while (answer != 'Y' && answer != 'y' && answer != 'N' && answer != 'n') {
            cout << "Invalid input. Please enter Y (yes) or N (no): ";
            cin >> answer;
        }
    }
    
    // BUG FIX #13: Professional program termination message
    // ORIGINAL ISSUE: May have been missing or incorrectly formatted
    // FIX: Clear termination message as specified in requirements
    // WHY IT WORKS: Provides clear indication that program is ending normally
    cout << "Program Finished." << endl;
    
    // BUG FIX #14: Proper return statement for main function
    // ORIGINAL ISSUE: void main() wouldn't have return statement
    // FIX: Return 0 to indicate successful program execution
    // WHY IT WORKS: Standard practice - 0 indicates success, non-zero indicates error
    // BEST PRACTICE: Always return 0 from main() for successful execution
    return 0;
