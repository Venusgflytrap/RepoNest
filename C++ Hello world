/*
 * Program Name: Hello World Application
 * Developer: [Your Name Here]
 * Date: [Current Date]
 * Course: CS 210 - Programming Languages
 * Institution: [Your Institution Name]
 * 
 * Purpose: This program demonstrates the fundamental structure of a C++ 
 *          application by displaying the classic "Hello, World!" message
 *          to the console. This serves as an introduction to basic C++
 *          syntax including preprocessor directives, namespace usage,
 *          the main function, and standard output operations.
 * 
 * Description: A simple console application that outputs a greeting message
 *              and demonstrates proper C++ program structure and formatting
 *              for educational purposes.

// Include the iostream library for input and output operations
// This header file contains definitions for cin, cout, and other I/O functions
#include <iostream>

// Use the standard namespace to avoid having to type "std::" before
// standard library functions like cout and endl
// This allows us to write "cout" instead of "std::cout"
using namespace std;

/*
 * Function: main
 * Purpose: Entry point of the C++ program - this is where execution begins
 * Parameters: None (could include int argc, char* argv[] for command line arguments)
 * Returns: int - returns 0 to indicate successful program execution

int main() {
    // Output the "Hello, World!" message to the console
    // cout is the standard output stream (console)
    // << is the stream insertion operator used to send data to cout
    // endl inserts a newline character and flushes the output buffer
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    
    // Return 0 to the operating system to indicate successful program completion
    // A return value of 0 means "no errors occurred"
    // Any non-zero return value typically indicates an error condition
    return 0;
