Problem Solved:
Corner Grocer needed to analyze daily purchase records to optimize store layout based on item frequency

Solution:
Created a C++ application that reads transaction data, counts item frequencies, and provides multiple visualization options

What You Did Well:
Implemented clean object-oriented design with proper encapsulation
Created robust error handling and input validation
Developed multiple data presentation formats (list, histogram)
Applied industry-standard commenting and documentation practices

Areas for Enhancement:
Add database connectivity for larger datasets
Implement more advanced data analytics (trends, seasonal patterns)
Create GUI interface for better user experience
Add data export capabilities (CSV, JSON formats)

Challenges Overcome:
File I/O Management: Learned to handle file reading/writing with proper error checking
STL Map Usage: Mastered associative containers for efficient data storage and retrieval
String Processing: Implemented case-insensitive searching and data cleaning
Menu System Design: Created intuitive user interface with input validation

Transferable Skills:
Data Processing: File handling, parsing, and transformation
Object-Oriented Design: Class architecture and encapsulation principles
Problem Decomposition: Breaking complex problems into manageable components
User Experience Design: Creating intuitive interfaces with clear feedback

Maintainability Features:
Modular Design: Separate classes for different responsibilities
Comprehensive Documentation: Detailed comments explaining functionality
Consistent Naming: Clear, descriptive variable and function names
Error Handling: Robust exception management and user feedback
